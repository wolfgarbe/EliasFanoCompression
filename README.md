EliasFanoCompression: quasi-succinct compression of sorted integers in C#

Elias-Fano encoding is **quasi succinct**, which means it is **almost as good as the best theoretical possible compression scheme** for sorted integers. 
While it can be used to compress any sorted list of integers, we will use it for compressing posting lists of inverted indexes.
Based on a research paper by Sebastiano Vigna: http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/QuasiSuccinctIndices.pdf
